Week 1

This week i used chatgpt to help me meal prep for the week. I went grocery shopping on sunday
and halfway through i realized i could have AI help me make meals that are high in protein but also
cheap for a college student. Chatgpt was able to create a whole plan that involved 3 meals a day for the entire week.
I found it interesting how diverisfied the meals were, all while maintaining the consistency of cheap,
tasty and nutritious foods. 

In terms of our class sessions, I had chatgpt help me organize certain data and provide an outliine for a code
i had started.

I really enjoyed this interction with AI and would encourage others to use it the way i am.
