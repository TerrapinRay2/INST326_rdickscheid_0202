this week i had the help of AI with doing statistical analysis. I kept getting errors that the dataset was incorrect or misplaced but it seemed right.
AI told me that i had a spelling issue like 20 rows of code up which then altered the entire program. This LLM was Gemini and it saved me a bunch of time.

I continue to use AI in a way that double checks my work, makes sure it is formatted correctly, and makes sense to an outside perspective.
