week 13
This week i didnt use much of AI. I tried to problem solve without the help of chat or other llms. 
However, i did use gemini for a syntax error i kept getting with the api keys. this was a simple fix that i initially thought wouldve been something bigger.
I also used chatgpt quite a bit for my personal life.
