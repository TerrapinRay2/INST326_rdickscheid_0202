Week 2

This week i used AI to help me with the problem sets. I had some issues figuring out how to use iterations when it came to for loops. It helped me
better understand how to actualyl use them and i feel more confident now. Other than that i didnt use much AI this week. Actually thats not true.
i did also use ChatGPT to remind me how to work with indexes just because i forgot how to use them over summer.
