#week 4 AI Journal

I used AI this week to help our team for the semester project. We had the ai help format/outline a timeline for us to get certain parts done by.
It helped a lot since it was a bit overwhelming with all the requirements, so Gemini helped us figure out certain deadlines and what steps should be taken before others.

On a more personal level, I used Copilot for some debugging help with one of the exercise codes in the homework since i didnt quite understand a few things.
