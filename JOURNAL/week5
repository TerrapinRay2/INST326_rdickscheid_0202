Week 5 AI journal prompt

This past week i used the help of Gemini for a couple of my statistic homework problems. It helped me understand
some formulas better and in a personalized way that allowed me to really remember it for my exam.

In terms of this class, I once again used copilot to help with some minor debugging issues for both the project and the week 5 exercises.
It also helped explain some concepts for me since i did end up missing a lecture this week.
