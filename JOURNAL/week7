This week I had AI help me with a couple class creations for the project. I kept getting errors with some of my code and I asked AI where i went wrong.
Gemini told me i should check a couple things icluding the indentation of my code. After checking, i realized i had 3 or 4 indentation errors. I also had Gemini
provide some feedback with my code, prompting it if there were any reconmmendations for making it smoother and more condensed. I didnt end up usig the recommendations but it was cool to see
how it helped in that sense. I also used Chatgpt for some things outside of this class that helped me with my physical health.
